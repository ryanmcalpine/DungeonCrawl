### CS-470 Final Project 
 #### by Nick Ivanov, Jason Juarez, and Ryan McAlpine

 ### Description
 A turn-based RPG battler where you control a party of three and delve into dungeons fighting a relentless gauntlet of randomized monsters while gathering loot from victorious battles. When the playerâ€™s party is defeated, they retain the new items and equipment that they found, as well as the experience they've gained, so the next time they start a playthrough they will be stronger and ready to push deeper into the dungeon!
