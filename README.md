### CS-470 Final Project 
 #### by Nick Ivanov, Jason Juarez, and Ryan McAlpine

 ### Description
 A turn-based RPG battler where you control a party of three and battle a relentless gauntlet of
 increasingly difficult monsters while gathering loot from victorious battles. When the playerâ€™s
 party is defeated, they retain the new gold they have earned, so that better equipment can be
 purchased from the Armory and equipped to their party members. Then, next time they start a
 playthrough, their party will be stronger and ready to push deeper into the dungeon! Will you be
 able to guide your party members all the way from being simple townsfolk to mighty adventurers?
